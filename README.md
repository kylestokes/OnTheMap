# On The Map üìç

This app lets you view locations and shared links from Udacity iOS Nanodegree students.  You can also post your own location and URL. ü§ôüèº

On the Map uses built-in Swift libraries for networking:
* [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)
